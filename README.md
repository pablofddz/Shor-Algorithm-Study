# Shor Algorithm Study
Code used to study Shor's algorithm and its implementations.<br>
Base code taken from https://github.com/sundewang233/shor_algorithm_simulation.<br>

# Packages needed
Qiskit 1.0.2 and Qiskit-Aer-Gpu 0.14.01.<br>
Contfrac and Concurrent packages are also needed.<br>
Running on Python 3.10.12.<br>

# Files
cuentaIBM.py: Enter your IBM Quantum token and execute this file before running the file that executes on a quantum computer (ordenadorcuantico.py).<br>
ordenadorcuantico.py: File that runs the classic implementation of the Shor algorithm on an IBM quantum computer (presaved ibm_brisbane).<br>
simulador.py: File that simulates Shor's algorithm and that offers a handful of options on how to run it.
